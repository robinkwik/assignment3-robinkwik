# A9501 Assignment 3

## Part 1: 
Find some of your own old code that makes plots (or use the sample Python code provided), and rewrite it according to the good programming principles discussed in class - including documentation. Use git to track your changes and submit the project as a repository. Include sample plot outputs.

## Part 2: 
You’ll be assigned another student’s project to review. Try to make their code work, check it against the programming advice, and submit a review and suggestions for improvements via the GitHub “issues” on their repository.
